Multithreaded
```
### 2. What is JVM?
```The JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. A program’s execution is divided into three stages. A Java program is written, compiled and then run.```

![JVM]()

As we can see in the above image, first the JVM language classes are processed by the class loader subsystem which is responsible for loading, linking and initialization of the java classes. After being processed by the class loader, the generated files are stored in the JVM Memory which consists of method area, heap, JVM language stacks, PC registers and native method stacks. The execution engine accesses the files from this JVM memory and makes use of the Native Method Interface and Native Method Libraries.

- A Java programmer creates a program.
- The JAVAC compiler, which is a primary Java compiler provided in the Java development kit (JDK), is used to compile the code. It accepts a Java application as input and outputs bytecode.
- JVM runs the bytecode generated by the compiler during the program’s Running phase.

The Java Virtual Machine’s job is to run the bytecode generated by the compiler. Although each operating system has its own JVM, the output they provide after bytecode execution is consistent across all of them. Java is known as a platform-independent language for this reason.

### 3. What is JRE with Diagram.

```The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with the JDK. The JRE installation on our computers allows us to run the Java program, but we cannot compile it. A browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins are all included in JRE. JRE is required for a computer to run a Java program.```

### 4. What is JDK with Diagram.

```Java Development Kit (JDK), When we learn about bytecode and JVM, we use the name JDK. As the name implies, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything from the compiler to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), debuggers, and documentation. In order to design, compile, and run the java application, we must first install JDK on our computer.```

### 5. What is byte code?
```Bytecode is a type of intermediate code generated by the compiler after source code has been compiled (JAVA Program). Java is a platform-independent language thanks to this intermediate code.```

### 6. What is Exception? && What are Checked and unchecked exceptions? && Define run time Exception.

![diagram on Exception](https://cdn.rollbar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/types-of-exceptions-in-java-checked-unchecked.png)

**An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.**
When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.
<br>

**RunTime Exception**

RuntimeExceptions are those exceptions which are checked at runtime. RuntimeException is the superclass of all those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal execution of the Java program. These are also called as unchecked exceptions. RuntimeException and their subclasses are known as unchecked exceptions. RuntimeExceptions can be avoided by programmer.
<br>

**Checked Exceptions**

The code below shows the FileInputStream method from the java.io package with a red line underneath. The red line is because this method throws a checked exception and the compiler is forcing us to handle it.
<br>

**Unchecked Exceptions**

An unchecked exception (also known as an runtime exception) in Java is something that has gone wrong with the program and is unrecoverable. Just because this is not a compile time exception, meaning you do not need to handle it, that does not mean you don’t need to be concerned about it.

The most common Java unchecked exception is the good old NullPointerException which is when you are trying to access a variable or object that doesn’t exist.

<br>

**summarize** the difference between a checked and unchecked exception is that a checked exception is caught at compile time whereas a runtime or unchecked exception is, as it states, at runtime. A checked exception must be handled either by re-throwing or with a try catch block, a runtime isn’t required to be handled. An unchecked exception is a programming error and are fatal, whereas a checked exception is an exception condition within your codes logic and can be recovered or retried from.

### 7. What is ServerSocket?

**ServerSocket is a java.net class that provides a system-independent implementation of the server side of a client/server socket connection.** ServerSocket Class is used for providing system-independent implementation of the server-side of a client/server Socket Connection. The constructor for ServerSocket throws an exception if it can’t listen on the specified port (for example, the port is already being used).

### 8. What is dynamic method dispatch? 

**Dynamic method dispatch** is the mechanism in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time instead of compile time. This is an important concept because of how Java implements run-time polymorphism.
<br><br>
Java uses the principle of _‘a superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object’_ to resolve calls to overridden methods at run time. When a superclass reference is used to call an overridden method, Java determines which version of the method to execute based on the type of the object being referred to at the time call.
<br><br>
In other words, it is the type of object being referred to that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.

### 9. Use of String buffer class

**StringBuffer** is a peer class of **String** that provides much of the functionality of strings. The string represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences. StringBuffer may have characters and substrings inserted in the middle or appended to the end. It will automatically grow to make room for such additions and often has more characters preallocated than are actually needed, to allow room for growth.
<br>

**StringBuffer** class is used to create mutable (modifiable) string. The StringBuffer class in java is same as String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.

### 10. What is java Token?

The Java compiler breaks the line of code into text (words) is called **Java tokens**. These are the smallest element of the Java program. The Java compiler identified these words as tokens. These tokens are separated by the delimiters. It is useful for compilers to detect errors. Remember that the delimiters are not part of the Java tokens.
<br>

```token <= identifier | keyword | separator | operator | literal | comment ```
<br>
In Java, the program contains classes and methods. Further, the methods contain the expressions and statements required to perform a specific operation. These statements and expressions are made up of tokens.
<img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/core/images/java-tokens.png" alt="token image" />


### 11. Argument and Parameter.

There is a major difference between Argument and Parameter, Actually Argument is the actual value where as parameter is a varible.

Example:

```java
public static int sum(int a, int b){ // Parameters
    return a+b;
}
public static void main(String [] args){
    int a = 5;
    int b = 25;
    int c;
    c = sum(a,b);  // Argument
    int d = sum(4,7); // Argument
}
```
### 12. Concurrency and Parallelism is different things.

__Concurrency__ is about multiple tasks which start, run, and complete in **overlapping time periods**, in no specific order. __Parallelism__ is about multiple tasks or subtasks of the same task that literally **run at the same time** on a hardware with multiple computing resources like multi-core processor.

-  Command line arguments

**JVM** :- 

### 14. Write a program in java to do the following :
-  To swap the two numbers without using the third variable.
-  Factorial of a number using recursion

**Swap Using without Temporary Varibale**
```java

public class Swap {
    public static void swapWithoutTemp(int x, int y){
        x = x + y;
        y = x - y;
        x = x - y;
        System.out.println("After Swapping");

        System.out.println(" x = " + x + " y = " + y);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x;
        int y;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the value of X ");
        x = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the value of Y ");
        y = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Before Swapping");
        System.out.println(" x = " + x + " y = " + y);
        swapWithoutTemp(x, y);
        
    }

    public static int factorial(int n) {
        // base Case
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

### 16. What are different types of Inheritance supported by Java explain in detail? && What is multilevel inheritance? Write a program to demonstrate it. && Demonstrate the use of Super keyword in inheritance with the help of example. 

**What is Inheritance** :- Inheritance is a propery that promtes code resuability. It is one of the most imporatnt pillar of Object Oriented Programming. It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. In Java, inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.  

**Types of Inheritance**<br>
1. Single Inheritance - Subclasses inherit the features of a single superclass via single inheritance. Class A acts as a base class for the derived class B.<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/645/original/Single_Inheritance.png?1643385936" alt="SI" width="300"/>


<br>

**Program**

```java

class Human {
    public int age;

    public void getAge(int age) {
        System.out.println("I am of Human Class and my age is " + age);
    }
}

class Coder extends Human {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("I am Eating.");
    }

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("I am Sleeping.");
    }

    public void Code() {
        System.out.println("I am Coding.");
    }
}

public class Inheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coder abhinav = new Coder();
        int x = 21;
        abhinav.getAge(x);
        abhinav.sleep();
        abhinav.eat();
        abhinav.Code();

    }
}
```
**Output**

```bash
geek@g3:~/java_program/OOPS$ cd "/home/geek/java_program/OOPS/" && javac Inheritance.java && java Inheritance
I am of Human Class and my age is 21
I am Sleeping.
I am Eating.
I am Coding.
```
2. Multilevel Inheritance: In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class inherits from a base class, and the derived class also serves as the base class for other classes. Class A serves as a base class for derived class B, which in turn serves as a base class for derived class C in the diagram below. In Java, a class cannot directly access the members of a grandparent.<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/646/original/Multilevel_Inheritance.png?1643385985" alt="MLI" width="300"/>


**Program**


```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```
3. Hierarchical Inheritance - One class serves as a superclass (base class) for several subclasses in Hierarchical Inheritance. Class A acts as a base class for the derived classes B, C, and D in the diagram below.<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/647/original/Hierarchical_Inheritance.png?1643386044" alt="HI" width="300"/>

**Program**

```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```
4. Multiple Inheritance: When a class inherits from more than one class, it is referred to as multiple inheritances. The below image shows class C inheriting from classes A and B.<br>
__Java does not support multiple inheritances as it can lead to ambiguity. We can implement the concept of multiple inheritances through the use of interfaces__
<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/648/original/Multiple_Inheritance.png?1643386118" alt="MLI" width="300"/>



**Program**

```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```


5. Hybrid Inheritance - Hybrid Inheritance is a blend of two or more of the inheritance kinds listed above. The below figure shows two classes B and C inheriting from class A and a class D inheriting from both classes B and C<br>
<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/650/original/Hybrid_Inheritance.png?1643386218" alt="MLI" width="300"/>


**Program**
```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```


```Runtime polymorphism, often known as Dynamic Method Dispatch```
### 17. What is CLA? (Command Line Argument)

The java command-line argument is an argument i.e. passed at the time of running the java program.

The arguments passed from the console can be received in the java program and it can be used as an input.

So, it provides a convenient way to check the behavior of the program for the different values. You can pass N (1,2,3 and so on) numbers of arguments from the command prompt.

**Program**

```java
public class CLA {
    //Command Line Argument in Java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("My first Command line argument is " +  args[0]);
    }
}
```

**Output**
```bash
geek@g3: javac CLA.java
geek@g3: java CLA abhinav
My first Command line argument is abhinav
```

### 18 What is difference between interface and abstract class? || Explain about interfaces. How they are different from the abstract classes?

**Program for Abstract Class**

```java
abstract class Car {
    public void color() {
        System.out.println("I am Black in Color");
    }

    abstract void wheel();

    abstract void engine();
}

class Thar extends Car {
    void wheel() {
        System.out.println("It has 4 wheel.");
    }

    void engine() {
        System.out.println("It has 400 HP engine.");
    }
}

public class Abstract {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thar thar = new Thar();
        thar.color();
        thar.wheel();
        thar.engine();
    }

}
```

***Interface Program***

```java
interface Phone {
    void button();

    void battery();
    // Default keyword is used to incoperate definition of the method.
    default void simSlot(){
        System.out.println("I am a single sim Mobile with default behaviour.");
    }

}

interface Smartphone {
    void touch();

    void camera();
}

class motrolaG51 implements Phone, Smartphone {
    @Override
    public void button() {
        System.out.println("I Am button for power off/on");
    }

    @Override
    public void battery() {
        System.out.println("I am 5000maH bateery");
    }

    @Override
    public void touch() {
        System.out.println("I am 120Hz touch panel");
    }

    @Override
    public void camera() {
        System.out.println("I am 30Mpx Camera");
    }

}
class motrolaG51A implements Phone, Smartphone {
    @Override
    public void button() {
        System.out.println("I Am button for power off/on");
    }

    @Override
    public void battery() {
        System.out.println("I am 5000maH bateery");
    }

    @Override
    public void touch() {
        System.out.println("I am 120Hz touch panel");
    }

    @Override
    public void camera() {
        System.out.println("I am 30Mpx Camera");
    }
    @Override
    public void simSlot(){
        System.out.println("I am double sim Smartphone.");
    }

}

public class Interface {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        motrolaG51 m51 = new motrolaG51();
        motrolaG51A m51A = new motrolaG51A();
        m51.battery();
        m51.button();
        m51.camera();
        m51.touch();
        m51.simSlot();
        m51A.battery();
        m51A.button();
        m51A.camera();
        m51A.touch();
        m51A.simSlot();
        
    }
}
```



### 19 What is use of keyword throws?  && Throw Vs Throws

Both **throw** and **throws** are concepts of exception handling in Java. The throws keyword is used to declare which exceptions can be thrown from a method, while the throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a method or block of code.

<br>

The **throws** keyword is used in a method signature and declares which exceptions can be thrown from a method. The throws keyword can be useful for propagating exceptions in the call stack and allows exceptions to not necessarily be handled within the method that declares these exceptions.

**Syntax**
```java
type method (arguments) throws Exception1, Exception2, … {  }
```

<br>
On the other hand, the throw keyword is used within a method body, or any block of code, and is used to explicitly throw a single exception. The throw keyword can be useful for throwing exceptions based on certain conditions within a code block and for throwing custom exceptions.

**Syntax**
```java
throw throwableObject;
```
**Example**

```java
public class throwVSthrows {
    static int division(int a, int b) throws ArithmeticException {
        return a / b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 25;
        int b = 0;
        try {
            int c = a / b;
            System.out.println(c);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception by throw keyword");
            throw e;
        } finally {
            try {
                System.out.println(division(a, b));
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Exception by Throws from division function.");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 20 What is a Wrapper Class?

Wrapper classes in Java provides a way to wrap or represent the value of primitive data types as an object. By creating an object to the wrapper class, a data field is created and in this field we can store the value of a primitive data type.
<br>
It also include methods to unwrap the objects back into the primitive data types. It is one of the classes provided in the java.lang package and all of the primitive wrapper classes in Java are immutable.

### 26 Explain about the applet and its life cycle. || Explain about the applet and its life cycle. || Difference between application and applet. || How do we pass parameters to applets in Java?

[Applets Code](/Event_Handling/TryingApplets.java)

**Life Cycle of Applets**
<br>

**init()**: The init() method is the first method to run that initializes the applet. It can be invoked only once at the time of initialization. The web browser creates the initialized objects, i.e., the web browser (after checking the security settings) runs the init() method within the applet.
<br>

**start()**: The start() method contains the actual code of the applet and starts the applet. It is invoked immediately after the init() method is invoked. Every time the browser is loaded or refreshed, the start() method is invoked. It is also invoked whenever the applet is maximized, restored, or moving from one tab to another in the browser. It is in an inactive state until the init() method is invoked.
<br>

**stop()**: The stop() method stops the execution of the applet. The stop () method is invoked whenever the applet is stopped, minimized, or moving from one tab to another in the browser, the stop() method is invoked. When we go back to that page, the start() method is invoked again.
<br>

**destroy()**: The destroy() method destroys the applet after its work is done. It is invoked when the applet window is closed or when the tab containing the webpage is closed. It removes the applet object from memory and is executed only once. We cannot start the applet once it is destroyed.
<br>

**paint()**: The paint() method belongs to the Graphics class in Java. It is used to draw shapes like circle, square, trapezium, etc., in the applet. It is executed after the start() method and when the browser or applet windows are resized.
<br>
