![JVM]()

As we can see in the above image, first the JVM language classes are processed by the class loader subsystem which is responsible for loading, linking and initialization of the java classes. After being processed by the class loader, the generated files are stored in the JVM Memory which consists of method area, heap, JVM language stacks, PC registers and native method stacks. The execution engine accesses the files from this JVM memory and makes use of the Native Method Interface and Native Method Libraries.

- A Java programmer creates a program.
- The JAVAC compiler, which is a primary Java compiler provided in the Java development kit (JDK), is used to compile the code. It accepts a Java application as input and outputs bytecode.
- JVM runs the bytecode generated by the compiler during the program’s Running phase.

The Java Virtual Machine’s job is to run the bytecode generated by the compiler. Although each operating system has its own JVM, the output they provide after bytecode execution is consistent across all of them. Java is known as a platform-independent language for this reason.

### 3. What is JRE with Diagram.

```The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with the JDK. The JRE installation on our computers allows us to run the Java program, but we cannot compile it. A browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins are all included in JRE. JRE is required for a computer to run a Java program.```

### 4. What is JDK with Diagram.

```Java Development Kit (JDK), When we learn about bytecode and JVM, we use the name JDK. As the name implies, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything from the compiler to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), debuggers, and documentation. In order to design, compile, and run the java application, we must first install JDK on our computer.```

### 5. What is byte code?
```Bytecode is a type of intermediate code generated by the compiler after source code has been compiled (JAVA Program). Java is a platform-independent language thanks to this intermediate code.```

### 6. What is Exception?

**An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.**
When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.

### 7. What is ServerSocket?

**ServerSocket is a java.net class that provides a system-independent implementation of the server side of a client/server socket connection.** ServerSocket Class is used for providing system-independent implementation of the server-side of a client/server Socket Connection. The constructor for ServerSocket throws an exception if it can’t listen on the specified port (for example, the port is already being used).

### 8. What is dynamic method dispatch? 

**Dynamic method dispatch** is the mechanism in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time instead of compile time. This is an important concept because of how Java implements run-time polymorphism.
<br><br>
Java uses the principle of _‘a superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object’_ to resolve calls to overridden methods at run time. When a superclass reference is used to call an overridden method, Java determines which version of the method to execute based on the type of the object being referred to at the time call.
<br><br>
In other words, it is the type of object being referred to that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.

### 9. Use of String buffer class

**StringBuffer** is a peer class of **String** that provides much of the functionality of strings. The string represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences. StringBuffer may have characters and substrings inserted in the middle or appended to the end. It will automatically grow to make room for such additions and often has more characters preallocated than are actually needed, to allow room for growth.
<br>

**StringBuffer** class is used to create mutable (modifiable) string. The StringBuffer class in java is same as String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.

### 10. What is java Token?

The Java compiler breaks the line of code into text (words) is called **Java tokens**. These are the smallest element of the Java program. The Java compiler identified these words as tokens. These tokens are separated by the delimiters. It is useful for compilers to detect errors. Remember that the delimiters are not part of the Java tokens.
<br>

```token <= identifier | keyword | separator | operator | literal | comment ```
<br>
In Java, the program contains classes and methods. Further, the methods contain the expressions and statements required to perform a specific operation. These statements and expressions are made up of tokens.

### 11. Argument and Parameter.

There is a major difference between Argument and Parameter, Actually Argument is the actual value where as parameter is a varible.

Example:

```java
public static int sum(int a, int b){ // Parameters
    return a+b;
}
public static void main(String [] args){
    int a = 5;
    int b = 25;
    int c;
    c = sum(a,b);  // Argument
    int d = sum(4,7); // Argument
}
```
### 12. Concurrency and Parallelism is different things.

__Concurrency__ is about multiple tasks which start, run, and complete in **overlapping time periods**, in no specific order. __Parallelism__ is about multiple tasks or subtasks of the same task that literally **run at the same time** on a hardware with multiple computing resources like multi-core processor.

### 14. Write a program in java to do the following :
-  To swap the two numbers without using the third variable.
-  Factorial of a number using recursion

**Swap Using without Temporary Varibale**
```java
import java.util.*;;
public class Swap {
    public static void swapWithoutTemp(int x, int y){
        x = x + y;
        y = x - y;
        x = x - y;
        System.out.println("After Swapping");

        System.out.println(" x = " + x + " y = " + y);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x;
        int y;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the value of X ");
        x = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the value of Y ");
        y = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Before Swapping");
        System.out.println(" x = " + x + " y = " + y);
        swapWithoutTemp(x, y);
        
    }
}
```

**Output**
```bash
geek@g3:~/java_program/praticeESE$ cd "/home/geek/java_program/praticeESE/" && javac Swap.java && java Swap
Enter the value of X 
5
Enter the value of Y 
15
Before Swapping
 x = 5 y = 15
After Swapping
 x = 15 y = 5
 ```

**Factorial Program Recursively**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FactorialRec {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        // base Case
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the value of N ");
        n = sc.nextInt();
        int factorial = factorial(n);
        System.out.println(factorial);
    }

}

        for (int j = 2; j < n; j++) {
            flag = true;
            for (int i = 2; i < j; i++) {
                if (j % i == 0) {
                    flag = false;
                    break;

```
### 16. What are different types of Inheritance supported by Java explain in detail?

**What is Inheritance** :- Inheritance is a propery that promtes code resuability. It is one of the most imporatnt pillar of Object Oriented Programming. It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. In Java, inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.  

**Types of Inheritance**<br>
1. Single Inheritance - Subclasses inherit the features of a single superclass via single inheritance. Class A acts as a base class for the derived class B.<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/645/original/Single_Inheritance.png?1643385936" alt="SI" width="200"/>


<br>

**Program**

```java

class Human {
    public int age;

    public void getAge(int age) {
        System.out.println("I am of Human Class and my age is " + age);
    }
}

class Coder extends Human {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("I am Eating.");
    }

    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("I am Sleeping.");
    }

    public void Code() {
        System.out.println("I am Coding.");
    }
}

public class Inheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coder abhinav = new Coder();
        int x = 21;
        abhinav.getAge(x);
        abhinav.sleep();
        abhinav.eat();
        abhinav.Code();

    }
}
```
**Output**

```bash
geek@g3:~/java_program/OOPS$ cd "/home/geek/java_program/OOPS/" && javac Inheritance.java && java Inheritance
I am of Human Class and my age is 21
I am Sleeping.
I am Eating.
I am Coding.
```
2. Multilevel Inheritance: In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class inherits from a base class, and the derived class also serves as the base class for other classes. Class A serves as a base class for derived class B, which in turn serves as a base class for derived class C in the diagram below. In Java, a class cannot directly access the members of a grandparent.<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/646/original/Multilevel_Inheritance.png?1643385985" alt="MLI" width="200"/>


**Program**


```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```
3. Hierarchical Inheritance - One class serves as a superclass (base class) for several subclasses in Hierarchical Inheritance. Class A acts as a base class for the derived classes B, C, and D in the diagram below.<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/647/original/Hierarchical_Inheritance.png?1643386044" alt="HI" width="200"/>

**Program**

```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```
4. Multiple Inheritance: When a class inherits from more than one class, it is referred to as multiple inheritances. The below image shows class C inheriting from classes A and B.<br>
__Java does not support multiple inheritances as it can lead to ambiguity. We can implement the concept of multiple inheritances through the use of interfaces__
<br>

**Program**

```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```


5. Hybrid Inheritance - Hybrid Inheritance is a blend of two or more of the inheritance kinds listed above. The below figure shows two classes B and C inheriting from class A and a class D inheriting from both classes B and C<br>

<img src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/002/650/original/Hybrid_Inheritance.png?1643386218" alt="MLI" width="200"/>



**Program**
```java


```
**Output**

```bash
```


```Runtime polymorphism, often known as Dynamic Method Dispatch```
### 17. What is CLA? (Command Line Argument)

The java command-line argument is an argument i.e. passed at the time of running the java program.

The arguments passed from the console can be received in the java program and it can be used as an input.

So, it provides a convenient way to check the behavior of the program for the different values. You can pass N (1,2,3 and so on) numbers of arguments from the command prompt.

**Program**

```java
public class CLA {
    //Command Line Argument in Java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("My first Command line argument is " +  args[0]);
    }
}
```

**Output**
```bash
geek@g3: javac CLA.java
geek@g3: java CLA abhinav
My first Command line argument is abhinav
```
