### 1. List four important features of Java language.  || Pros of Java Programming Language.
```
Object-Oriented 
Secure
Platform Independent
Robust
Multithreaded
```
### 2. What is JVM?
```The JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. A program’s execution is divided into three stages. A Java program is written, compiled and then run.```

As we can see in the above image, first the JVM language classes are processed by the class loader subsystem which is responsible for loading, linking and initialization of the java classes. After being processed by the class loader, the generated files are stored in the JVM Memory which consists of method area, heap, JVM language stacks, PC registers and native method stacks. The execution engine accesses the files from this JVM memory and makes use of the Native Method Interface and Native Method Libraries.

- A Java programmer creates a program.
- The JAVAC compiler, which is a primary Java compiler provided in the Java development kit (JDK), is used to compile the code. It accepts a Java application as input and outputs bytecode.
- JVM runs the bytecode generated by the compiler during the program’s Running phase.

The Java Virtual Machine’s job is to run the bytecode generated by the compiler. Although each operating system has its own JVM, the output they provide after bytecode execution is consistent across all of them. Java is known as a platform-independent language for this reason.

### 3. What is JRE with Diagram.

```The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with the JDK. The JRE installation on our computers allows us to run the Java program, but we cannot compile it. A browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins are all included in JRE. JRE is required for a computer to run a Java program.```

### 4. What is JDK with Diagram.

```Java Development Kit (JDK), When we learn about bytecode and JVM, we use the name JDK. As the name implies, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything from the compiler to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), debuggers, and documentation. In order to design, compile, and run the java application, we must first install JDK on our computer.```

### 5. What is byte code?
```Bytecode is a type of intermediate code generated by the compiler after source code has been compiled (JAVA Program). Java is a platform-independent language thanks to this intermediate code.```

### 6. What is Exception?

**An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.**
When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.

### 7. What is ServerSocket?

**ServerSocket is a java.net class that provides a system-independent implementation of the server side of a client/server socket connection.** ServerSocket Class is used for providing system-independent implementation of the server-side of a client/server Socket Connection. The constructor for ServerSocket throws an exception if it can’t listen on the specified port (for example, the port is already being used).

### 8. What is dynamic method dispatch? 

**Dynamic method dispatch** is the mechanism in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time instead of compile time. This is an important concept because of how Java implements run-time polymorphism.
<br><br>
Java uses the principle of _‘a superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object’_ to resolve calls to overridden methods at run time. When a superclass reference is used to call an overridden method, Java determines which version of the method to execute based on the type of the object being referred to at the time call.
<br><br>
In other words, it is the type of object being referred to that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.

### 9. Use of String buffer class

**StringBuffer** is a peer class of **String** that provides much of the functionality of strings. The string represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences. StringBuffer may have characters and substrings inserted in the middle or appended to the end. It will automatically grow to make room for such additions and often has more characters preallocated than are actually needed, to allow room for growth.
<br>

**StringBuffer** class is used to create mutable (modifiable) string. The StringBuffer class in java is same as String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.

### 10. What is java Token?

The Java compiler breaks the line of code into text (words) is called **Java tokens**. These are the smallest element of the Java program. The Java compiler identified these words as tokens. These tokens are separated by the delimiters. It is useful for compilers to detect errors. Remember that the delimiters are not part of the Java tokens.
<br>

```token <= identifier | keyword | separator | operator | literal | comment ```
<br>
In Java, the program contains classes and methods. Further, the methods contain the expressions and statements required to perform a specific operation. These statements and expressions are made up of tokens.
