## Java Question Bank

### 1. List four important features of Java language. 
```
Object-Oriented 
Secure
Platform Independent
Robust
Multithreaded
```
### 2. What is JVM?
```The JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. A program’s execution is divided into three stages. A Java program is written, compiled and then run.```

As we can see in the above image, first the JVM language classes are processed by the class loader subsystem which is responsible for loading, linking and initialization of the java classes. After being processed by the class loader, the generated files are stored in the JVM Memory which consists of method area, heap, JVM language stacks, PC registers and native method stacks. The execution engine accesses the files from this JVM memory and makes use of the Native Method Interface and Native Method Libraries.

- A Java programmer creates a program.
- The JAVAC compiler, which is a primary Java compiler provided in the Java development kit (JDK), is used to compile the code. It accepts a Java application as input and outputs bytecode.
- JVM runs the bytecode generated by the compiler during the program’s Running phase.

The Java Virtual Machine’s job is to run the bytecode generated by the compiler. Although each operating system has its own JVM, the output they provide after bytecode execution is consistent across all of them. Java is known as a platform-independent language for this reason.

### 3. What is JRE and JDK with Explainantion.

```The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with the JDK. The JRE installation on our computers allows us to run the Java program, but we cannot compile it. A browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins are all included in JRE. JRE is required for a computer to run a Java program.```

```Java Development Kit (JDK), When we learn about bytecode and JVM, we use the name JDK. As the name implies, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything from the compiler to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), debuggers, and documentation. In order to design, compile, and run the java application, we must first install JDK on our computer.```

### 4. What is byte code?
```Bytecode is a type of intermediate code generated by the compiler after source code has been compiled (JAVA Program). Java is a platform-independent language thanks to this intermediate code.```
